- **View Patients:** Enables users to view a comprehensive list of all patients along with their relevant details.
- **Emergency Situations:** Addresses emergency scenarios such as accidents, burns, diarrhea and dehydration, and cardiac arrest.

## Prerequisites

- To run the program, a C++ compiler is required. You can use [GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)](https://gcc.gnu.org/) for compiling the C++ code.
- Ensure that you have a terminal or command prompt to execute the compiled program.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:

   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o hospital_management_system
   ```

3. Run the compiled executable:

   ```bash
   ./hospital_management_system
   ```

## Usage

1. Upon launching the program, the user will be prompted to enter a username and password.
